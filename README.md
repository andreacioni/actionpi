<p align="center">Action/Dash camera powered by Raspberry Pi Zero </p>

# Introduction
ActionPi is a DIY project that gives everyone the opportunity to build an action/dash camera with a _20$_ budget.

>⚠️ Documentation is work in progress, please bear with me  ⚠️

# ✨ Features 

 - 📽 **FullHD** video recordings
 - 📥 **Download video** easily using USB cable or WiFi connection
 - 💡 **Rolling video appenders**: record video in a circular buffer, never overwrite on reboot
 - 🔨 **Robust design**: temperature control, OS read-only partition & low latency write-to-disk (never miss a single frame on power loss)
 - 🕹 **3D Printable case**: it's avaialble on Thingiverse
 
# Docs

Check out [wiki](https://github.com/andreacioni/actionpi/wiki/) to read how to setup your personal ActionPi.
 

# Do you want to build it on your own and/or contribute?

I'm currently looking for someone interested in build a prototype for personal usage and also help me in the documentation phase of this project.
